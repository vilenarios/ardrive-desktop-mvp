# Cline Rules for ArDrive Desktop MVP

## Project Context
This is an Electron desktop application for ArDrive (permanent file storage on Arweave).

## Key Rules
1. Always run `npm run typecheck` before committing changes
2. Use the secure wallet manager (`wallet-manager-secure.ts`) not the old one
3. Private drives are not yet implemented - only public drives work
4. Test with development credentials, never real wallets
5. Follow existing component patterns in src/renderer/components

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript errors
- `npm run build` - Build for production

## Architecture
- Main process: Node.js backend (src/main/)
- Renderer process: React frontend (src/renderer/)
- IPC: Communication between processes (see preload.ts)

## Testing
Use the UAT tools (Ctrl+D in dev mode) for quick testing.
