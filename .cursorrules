# Cursor Rules for ArDrive Desktop MVP

You are working on an Electron desktop application for ArDrive.

## Key Information
- Main process code is in src/main/ (Node.js)
- Renderer process code is in src/renderer/ (React)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Private drives are not implemented yet
- Always use wallet-manager-secure.ts, not wallet-manager.ts

## Before Making Changes
1. Check existing patterns in similar files
2. Run `npm run typecheck` to verify types
3. Test changes with `npm run dev`

## Common Patterns
- IPC handlers: See main.ts for examples
- React components: Follow Dashboard.tsx patterns
- Error handling: Always catch and log errors
- Security: Never log sensitive data

## Quick Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Development
npm run typecheck  # Check types
npm run build      # Build app
```
