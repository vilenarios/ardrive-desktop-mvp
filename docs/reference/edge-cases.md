# ArDrive Desktop Sync Edge Cases and Failure Scenarios

This document outlines potential edge cases and failure scenarios in the ArDrive Desktop MVP file/folder/drive synchronization process.

## üö® Critical Edge Cases (High Impact, High Likelihood)

### 1. File System Permissions & Access
- **Scenario**: User adds files they don't have read permission for
- **Current Issue**: App may crash or silently fail
- **Impact**: Sync stops working, user confusion
- **Example**: System files, admin-only directories
- **Mitigation**: Add permission validation before file operations

### 2. Concurrent File Modifications
- **Scenario**: File being edited while sync tries to upload it
- **Current Issue**: Hash mismatch, corrupted uploads, race conditions
- **Impact**: Failed uploads, wasted fees, inconsistent state
- **Example**: Large video file being edited in premiere while syncing
- **Mitigation**: Implement file locking and atomic operations

### 3. Network Interruptions During Upload
- **Scenario**: Internet disconnects mid-upload
- **Current Issue**: Partial upload, fees paid but file not stored
- **Impact**: Financial loss, data loss, sync inconsistency
- **Example**: WiFi drops during 500MB video upload
- **Mitigation**: Resumable uploads and better retry logic

### 4. Database Corruption/Inconsistency
- **Scenario**: App crashes during database write, power loss
- **Current Issue**: Corrupted sync state, lost file tracking
- **Impact**: Complete sync failure, need to re-sync everything
- **Example**: System crash while updating version history
- **Mitigation**: Database transactions and backup mechanisms

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Edge Cases (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)
