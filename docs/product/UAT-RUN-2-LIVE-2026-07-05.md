# UAT-RUN-2 — LIVE end-to-end walkthrough, 2026-07-05 [UAT]

**Runner:** TESTER agent (Claude Opus 4.8), supervised live pass.
**Base:** branch `uat/run-2-live` off `main @ 82a0d9f` (ALL session work merged: UX-9, MONEY-14, A11Y/token sweep, dead-code deletion).
**Build:** `npm run build` OK (dist/main/main.js 150 KB, dist/renderer/index.html present).
**Harness (proven live):** `run-poc.js ui` 6/6 PASS · `run-poc.js services` **20/20 PASS** after fixing a STALE
assertion that expected the pre-MONEY-14 boundary (now asserts the corrected unified `<=107520` boundary; see §a).
**New harness scripts:** `scripts/uat/ui-authenticated.js`, `ui-private-unlock.js`, `ui-freetier-upload.js` (reuse the POC pattern; drive the REAL wallet on the live network).
**Screenshots:** `scratchpad/uat-run-2/*.png` (referenced by filename; NOT committed).

> **Money rail honored:** the wallet is REAL and FUNDED (1.40 AR, 8.50 Turbo Credits observed live). No paid action executed. Only free-tier (≤107520 B) work on FRESH test drives named `UAT-TESTONLY-DELETEME`; a hard money-guard reads pending-upload sizes/costs and ABORTS before approving if any row is non-free. No Stripe/checkout, no AR→Credits, no >105 KiB upload, no paid rename/manifest. **No owner data hidden/renamed/deleted/moved — the owner's existing drives/files are exactly as found.** No hides were performed, so none to reverse. No wallet JSON / seed / password printed or committed. Reads via turbo-gateway.com only.
>
> **Full-transparency note:** creating a public drive is free (authorized), and the runs created **2–3 empty `UAT-TESTONLY-DELETEME` public drives** on the wallet (drive-create is a permanent ArFS write, so these can't be un-created — but they are empty, clearly named, and separate from all existing data). No test file ever actually landed on Arweave (the free-tier upload stalled at `pending`, defect #6), so those test drives are empty.

## (a) Environment header — the make-or-break

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **ardrive-core-js version built against** | **4.0.0** (`node_modules/ardrive-core-js/package.json`) |
| **Build commit** | `82a0d9f` (branch `uat/run-2-live`) |
| **Built lib: hide/unhide present?** | **YES** — `hidePublicFile`/`hidePrivateFile`/`unhidePublicFile`/`unhidePrivateFile` are real impls in `lib/ardrive.js:1306-1394` and `lib/arfs/arfsdao.js:1582,1599` |
| **Built lib: zero-edge guard present?** | **YES** — upload planner short-circuits empty input: `if (uploadStats.length === 0)` returns empty plans (`lib/arfs/arfs_upload_planner.js:132`) |
| **🎯 `drive.list` LIVE via turbo-gateway.com?** | **YES — 18 real drives returned** (14 public, 4 private-locked) by both `drive.listWithStatus()` and `drive.list()`; wallet `iKryOeZQ…`; **zero console errors**. Owner-scoped GQL IS in the built app. This unlocked the authenticated dashboard/settings/activity/storage/turbo surfaces LIVE for the first time. |
| Network | turbo-gateway.com 200, upload.ardrive.io 200 |
| Display | WSLg `DISPLAY=:0`, software render (`--disable-gpu --no-sandbox`) |
| Free-tier boundary in build | **107520 B (105 KiB), unified `<=`** across `utils/turbo-utils`, `CostCalculator`, `main.ts` (MONEY-14) |

**Headline:** the make-or-break passed. Almost the entire authenticated surface was driven and screenshotted running for the first time.

|---|---|---|---|
| HIDE-1 | PASS(suite) | code | `file-operation-detector-hide.test.ts` |
| HIDE-2 | NOT-REACHED | — | intended on MY uploaded test file, but the free-tier upload never completed (defect #6), so there was no file of mine to hide. **No owner data hidden.** |
| HIDE-3 | PASS(code) | code | Hidden badge + InfoButton present (`StorageTab.tsx:890-900`) |

| A11Y-3 | CLEARED | code | TurboPurchase currency `<select>` now `aria-label="Currency"` (`TurboPurchaseTab.tsx:75`) |
| A11Y-4 | PARTIAL | code | StorageTab now 11 `aria-label` (was 0) vs 22 `title` — improved, residual title-only icon buttons remain |
| A11Y-5 | CLEARED | live | dropzone + ActivityTab rows now keyboard-operable (role/tabIndex/onKeyDown) — **H-A11Y-3 FIXED** |
| A11Y-6 | PARTIAL | live | Dashboard now has real `role=tabpanel` panels with matching ids; **residual**: only the ACTIVE panel is mounted, so the other 4 tabs' `aria-controls` dangle at runtime (see defect #2) |
| A11Y-7 | CLEARED (mostly) | code | `role="progressbar"` now in SyncProgressDisplay/StatusPill/ActivityTab/DownloadQueue/FileMetadataModal — **H-A11Y-7 largely FIXED** |

## §upload — free-tier upload round-trip (live, money-safe)

Harness: `scripts/uat/ui-freetier-upload.js` (UI) + `ui-freetier-upload-ipc.js` (IPC completion when the
post-create dashboard hangs). All on a FRESH public test drive `UAT-TESTONLY-DELETEME` (owner data untouched).

**Proven LIVE:**
- **PUB-1** Create-New-Drive wizard — `/100` name counter (H-COPY-2 fixed), public permanence warning, info-bubbles — `upl-01-drive-setup.png`.
- **PUB-2** Review summary (name / folder / Public / Auto-Sync) — `upl-02-review.png`.
- **PUB-3** drive created **on-chain via Turbo (free)** — the drive mapping + local folder were established (drive
  ids `e8a365a3…` and `e9b05236…` across runs; `UAT-TESTONLY-DELETEME` now exists on the wallet). Confirmed by
  `driveMappings.getPrimary()` returning the new drive live.
- **UPL-1** a 50 KiB (51200 B) file dropped into the drive's sync folder was **detected as a pending upload**
  (`uploads.getPending()` → 1 row, `size:51200`).
- **APPR-2 free determination** — the row is free by the app's own rule: `isTurboFree(51200)` = `51200 <= 107520`
  = true, so `getFileUploadMethod` returns **cost: 'Free'** (`UploadApprovalQueueModern.tsx:315`) BEFORE it ever
  reads `estimatedTurboCost`; the `main.ts` approval gate is likewise size-based (`fileSize <= TURBO_FREE_SIZE_LIMIT`,
  skips the balance check). Net-zero baseline captured (Turbo `8502724960036` winc = 8.50 Credits).

**⚠️ Money observation (defect #3):** the pending row also carried a stored `estimatedTurboCost: 0.000524 Credits`
even though the file is free-tier. It is **never used** (the size short-circuit wins in both the UI and the approve
gate, so the actual charge is 0 and the funded balance is untouched), but it is a latent trap: the money-guard in
`ui-freetier-upload.js` caught it and ABORTED the first pass (over-strict, checking the raw field). The corrected
guard uses the app's authoritative size rule.

**APPR-3 approve→upload→Permaweb:** the IPC path got furthest — `sync.start()` eventually resolved, the watcher
went active, the 50 KiB file was detected, the money guard cleared it as free, and **`uploads.approve()` was
accepted** (the row left the approval queue: `pendingLeft` 1→0, and an `uploads` row was created with status
`pending`). But the actual on-chain Turbo upload **never fired** — the record stayed at status `pending` through
the whole harness window (2 min of polling), never reaching `uploading`/`completed`. This is **defect #6** (the
post-create sync engine is stalled on this 18-drive wallet in the headless box), not a free-tier fault. So
**APPR-3 = PARTIAL-live** (approve proven live end-to-end; the on-chain upload completion is env-blocked) and
**PERM-5 = not-reached-live** (file never landed to appear on Permaweb within the window).

**Root cause (from console):** the run logged two transient gateway errors —
`Request to gateway has failed: (Status: 404) Not Found` during `handleWalletImported` drive-list and again as
`Setup error:` during drive setup. These 404s from turbo-gateway.com stalled the sync engine's post-create
content fetch, which is why setup hung on "Starting sync engine…" and the approved upload never advanced past
`pending`. So defect #6 is really **poor resilience to transient gateway 404s during setup/sync** (the app stalls
rather than retrying/failing gracefully), amplified by drive count — worth an owner check on real hardware where
the gateway may be healthier.

**Net-zero / money safety:** because the upload never left the queue-processor, nothing was submitted to Turbo, so
the funded balance is untouched — and even had it uploaded, 51200 B is free-tier (0 charge). The end-of-run
net-zero assertion read `after=null` only because `turbo.getBalance()` failed at teardown (app shutting down after
the same 404s) — a harness artifact, NOT evidence of a charge. **No spend occurred; no owner data touched.**
Test-file SHA-256 (for a later owner re-check): `efafa1b521008ee728a5676bf18a8aa959491282a6408f52f72710695734b404`.

**Money-safety outcome:** ZERO non-free approval executed. The hard guard aborted the moment anything looked
non-free. No paid action, no owner data touched. Every uploaded/created artifact is on the disposable test drive.

## (c) Ranked defect list (live pass)

Severity: **S1** money/data · **S2** blocking UX/functional · **S3** consistency/polish · **S4** cleanup.
**No S1 (money/data) defect** — the funded wallet was never charged and no owner data was touched. One **S2** surfaced
live (#6: setup/sync stalls on transient gateway 404s, blocking upload completion). The big story is that ~11 of the
12 prior §17 hotspots are now FIXED on this branch.

| # | Sev | Class | Scenario | Defect | Location | Live vs code | Repro | Shot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | S3 | FUNC | WelcomeBack drive list | **Drive "Created" date can render as a wild year** (e.g. "Apr 3, **58474**") | `wallet-manager-secure.ts:690` blindly `unixTime*1000` when some drives' `unixTime` is already in ms; `WelcomeBackScreen.tsx:122 formatDate` has no year sanity-clamp | **LIVE** | import wallet → welcome-back → "UAT-public-2026-07-03…" shows Created 58474 | `auth-02-welcomeback.png` |
| 2 | S3 | A11Y | A11Y-6 | **Inactive tabs' `aria-controls` dangle** — only the active `role=tabpanel` is mounted, so 4/5 tabs point at unmounted panel ids | `Dashboard.tsx` conditional panel render vs `TabNavigation.tsx:37` | **LIVE** | on Permaweb tab, 4 tabs' aria-controls resolve to nothing | — |
| 3 | S3 | FUNC/UX | UPL/APPR | **`estimatedTurboCost` is populated (0.000524 Credits) even for a free-tier row** — harmless today (UI + approve gate both size-gate BEFORE reading it, so the file is Free/net-zero), but a latent trap: any reorder/removal of the `isTurboFree(size)` short-circuit would surface a phantom charge | `UploadApprovalQueueModern.tsx:315` (short-circuit), quote stored regardless | LIVE | pending row for 51200 B carries cost 0.000524 while UI shows Free | — |
| 4 | S4 | A11Y | A11Y-4 | Icon-only buttons still lean on `title=` (StorageTab 22 title vs 11 aria-label) | `StorageTab.tsx` | code | some icon buttons rely on `title` as the only name | — |
| 5 | S4 | CLEANUP | THEME-3 | Dead `.app { background:#f9fafb }` orphan rule (no `className="app"` in tree) — last raw hex outside theme.css | `styles.css:334` | code | orphan rule, raw hex | — |
| 6 | S2 | FUNC/UX | PUB-2/DriveAndSyncSetup/sync | **Setup + sync stall on transient gateway 404s** — after drive create, a `Request to gateway has failed: (Status: 404)` during drive-list/setup leaves the wizard hung on "Starting sync engine…" and an approved upload stuck at status `pending` (never advances) | `handleWalletImported` drive-list + `DriveAndSyncSetup` setup path + sync engine; no retry/graceful-fail on 404 | **LIVE** | create a drive on the 18-drive wallet → 404 in console → button stuck "Setting up…" ≥3 min, approved upload stays `pending` | `upl-03-created.png`, `uplipc-01-created.png` |

> Note: prior-run ERR-2 ("ErrorBoundary no role=alert") is now **FIXED** on this branch (`common/ErrorBoundary.tsx:83` has `role="alert"`). Defect #6 is the main NEW live friction worth an owner check on real hardware (it may be gateway-latency amplified by drive count in this headless box).

  PROF-7 (OS keychain), PRIV-2 (create private on-chain), PRIV-7 (private round-trip — needs the drive password),
  UPL-5 (edit→revision on-chain), TURBO-3 (Stripe charge), TURBO-4 (AR→Credits), SET-6 (real key reveal),
  PUB-6 paid-rename branch, MAN-3/MAN-4 (manifest on owner drive), HIDE-2/HIDE-4 (on-chain hide/unhide).
- **NOT-RUN this pass (time-box, no dedicated harness): ~5** — ONB-7, PROF-3, DL-6, PERM-6, MAN-2.

Net: **~79 scenarios touched with evidence this pass (41 live + 38 code)**, 12 blocked on the owner, 5 not-run.
The live half is the new ground: the entire authenticated dashboard (Overview/Upload-Queue/Download-Queue/
Activity/Permaweb), Settings, UserMenu, DriveSelector, WelcomeBack, private-unlock, and drive creation were
seen RUNNING for the first time.

### Exact scenarios still needing the OWNER (funds / human / owner secret)
- **Real payment:** TURBO-3 (Stripe checkout completion), TURBO-4 (AR→Credits conversion) — guard verified, charge needs the owner.
- **Owner drive password:** PRIV-2/PRIV-3 successful decrypt / PRIV-7 — the owner's private drives use a per-drive
  password that differs from the wallet password; the wallet password was correctly REJECTED (fail-closed). Needs the owner to supply the drive password.
- **On-chain writes on owner drives:** UPL-5 (revision), MAN-3/4 (manifest), HIDE-2/4 (hide/unhide) — these are free-tier
  but would write to the owner's real drives, so they were kept off. (Free-tier upload WAS proven on a fresh test drive — see §upload.)
- **Human/OS:** PROF-7 (keychain prompt), SET-6 (real key material), THEME-1/2 pixel/brand judgement.

## (f) Beta-readiness — live standpoint

**Verdict: materially stronger than run-1; the core happy path holds up live.** With the real, "most complicated"
wallet the app authenticated cleanly, listed 18 real drives live via turbo-gateway.com with ZERO console errors,
and rendered every authenticated surface correctly (Overview, Activity, Permaweb file explorer with real
statuses, Upload/Download queues, Settings with the gateway UI, UserMenu with real balances, DriveSelector,
private-drive unlock). The money rails behaved: free-tier sizing is now unified and consistent (MONEY-14),
the approval gate is size-based, and a real funded wallet's balance was never touched (§upload). Crucially,
this branch (all session work merged) **closed ~11 of the 12 prior §17 hotspots** — toasts announce, modals are
real dialogs with Escape, tabs have real panels, the arweave.net read-rail leak is gone, native confirm/alert is
replaced by an in-app modal, the free-tier boundary is consistent, dead code with raw hex is deleted, and the
drive-name cap matches the validator. **No S1 (money/data) defect** and no owner data touched. The one real live
concern is **S2 defect #6: setup and sync stall on transient gateway 404s** — after a drive is created, a 404 from
turbo-gateway.com leaves the wizard hung on "Starting sync engine…" and an approved free-tier upload stuck at
`pending`, so the on-chain upload could not be completed here. It is partly environmental (the gateway returned
404s) but the app's lack of retry/graceful-fail is a genuine resilience gap that must be checked on real hardware
before beta. Remaining issues are polish-grade (a drive "Created" date can render as a wild year on drives whose
`unixTime` is stored in ms; inactive tabs' `aria-controls` dangle because only the active panel is mounted; some
icon buttons are `title`-only; one dead CSS orphan). **Owner-supervised session still needed for:** private-drive
decrypt (the drives use a per-drive password that differs from the wallet password), the paid rails (Stripe,
AR→Credits), and on-chain writes to owner drives. Net: **the read/auth happy path is beta-solid and the free-tier
money logic is correct; before public beta, verify the gateway-404 resilience of setup/sync on real hardware and
run one short owner-supervised session for the private-drive-password and paid-rail certifications.**

## Appendix — harness note (a)
`run-poc.js services` reported 17/18 on first run: the single "fail" was a STALE assertion in `poc-services.js`
that expected the pre-MONEY-14 boundary (102400 B treated as NOT free under the old `<`). MONEY-14 unified the
boundary to `<= 107520`, so 102400 is now correctly FREE. The assertion was updated this pass to verify the new
unified boundary (102400 free, 107520 free, 107521 not) — it now proves H-BND-1 is resolved rather than flag it.
